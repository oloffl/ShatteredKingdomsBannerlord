# Shattered Kingdoms

This mod makes (almost) every clan in every faction become their own kingdom and go to war with each other.

Help is always welcome, check out the known issues and make a pull request. 

Thanks to calsev for his template mod that got me started. https://github.com/calsev/bannerlord_smith_forever. 


### Installation

Drop the ShatteredKingdoms folder containing the SubModule.xml, bin and ModuleData in your M&B Bannerlord Modules folder, enable it in the launcher and create a new campaign.


### Known Issues

The original faction leader cannot unjoin his own faction
Clans which only own a castle cannot become their own kingdom. I haven't figured out how to give them a town, help appriciated
Every clan exists as a kingdom in the encyclopedia, but they are not (this is because I changed the spkingdoms.xml believing that they could. I'm keeping it for now if I happen to figure it out)
