# Shattered Kingdoms

This mod makes (almost) every clan in every faction become their own kingdom and go to war with each other. 

Help is always welcome, check out the known issues and make a pull request or report a new issue. 


### Changelog

1.3.0
* Split off the rebellions into separate mod

1.0.3
* Modified chance to rebel to be lower but exponential. At 10 castles there's a 3% chance each week, 20 = 15%, 30 = 45%. Also removed the rebellion to be only for one castle/town, instead of all of them. 

1.0.2
* Dynamic rebellions now available, every week a die is rolled for each large kingdom. The larger the kingdom, the more likely a rebellion will strike. Multiple randomly generated kingdoms spawn and attack castles around the kingdom. They might win and become a new contender, or they will fail and will have weakend the kingdom's armies. 
* Improved some secondary colors

1.0.1
* Changed colors for kingdoms and clans, feedback/suggestions are welcome

### Installation

Drop the ShatteredKingdoms folder containing the SubModule.xml, bin and ModuleData in your M&B Bannerlord Modules folder, enable it in the launcher and create a new campaign.

Also check if the .dll in the bin folder is not blocked by windows by right clicking on it and checking properties.


### Known Issues

1. The original kingdom leader cannot unjoin his own faction
2. (This is now alleviated by random rebellions occuring) Clans which at a start of a new campaign only own a castle cannot become their own kingdom. This results in the original kingdom having more clans than the ones who break off.
