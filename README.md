# Shattered Kingdoms

This mod makes (almost) every clan in every faction become their own kingdom and go to war with each other.

Help is always welcome, check out the known issues and make a pull request or report a new issue. 


### Installation

Drop the ShatteredKingdoms folder containing the SubModule.xml, bin and ModuleData in your M&B Bannerlord Modules folder, enable it in the launcher and create a new campaign.

Also check if the .dll in the bin folder is not blocked by windows by right clicking on it and checking properties.


### Changelog

1.0.1
* Changed colors for kingdoms and clans, feedback/suggestions are welcome


### Known Issues

1. The original kingdom leader cannot unjoin his own faction
2. Clans which only own a castle cannot become their own kingdom. I haven't figured out how to give them a town, help appriciated. This results in the original kingdom having more clans than the ones who break off.
3. Every clan exists as a kingdom in the encyclopedia, but they are not (this is because I changed the spkingdoms.xml believing that they could. I'm keeping it for now if I happen to figure it out)
4. A report of high RAM to crash at campaign start
5. Possible mod conflict with DiplomacyReworked https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/427
