	ASURAI
	Jawwal, Ghilman0
	The Asuri, three tribes who all trace their lineage to the ancient patriarch Asur, were nomads who were established as a client kingdom to guard the Empire's south, essentially being paid to protect caravans instead of raid them. As the empire contracts they have made themselves independent, and indeed have pressed claims of marriage to the imperial throne itself.
	The leaders of the Banu Hulyan claim the title of Sultan of the Asuri. They are the richest of the clans in the south, masters of the key passes between the lake and the outer desert, and are seen by other tribes as haughty and amoral. They are close to the Ghulam, a group of warrior slaves that has converted itself to a mercenary military order.
	The Banu Sarran are recently settled bedouin, who seized the Banu Hulyan's holdings in the outer oases but were eventually accepted as clients and vassals. They are thought of as upstarts by the others, a reputation which they in fact relish. They celebrate their nomadic past with carefully poems on their success in battle over the other tribes, or in seducing the other tribes' daughters. This does not endear them to other Asuris. They maintain close ties with the Jawwal, a clan of outcasts who still keep the nomadic lifestyle.
	The Banu Qild are known as a dour ascetics, looking down from their desert fastnesses with disapproval on both the wealthy Banu Hulyan and the poor and roguish Banu Sarran. They answer readily enough to the Banu Hulyan's summons for war, but have also made hints that they may some day attempt to seize the sultanate to cleanse the Asuri lands from corruption.
	The Ghulam are an order of warrior-slaves. They originated as the bodyguard of an imperial noble who tried - and failed - to subdue the desert frontier, but during the chaos that preceded the establishment of the Asuri state they set themselves up as independent mercenaries. They purchase new recruits from slave markets across the empire, putting them through a rigorous course of training before initiating them into the order.

First the Empire fought them, then when that failed granted them noble titles and estates to make them into imperial clients, and then - when they rebelled - fought them again. Now they are an independent kingdom, known for steel-forging and their horses, and their armored riders are a constant menace to the Empire's western marches.

	KHUZAITS
	The Khuzaits thundered into the steppes west of Lake Baetiros two generations ago, driving other nomads before them. They and their vassal tribes, the Khergit and the Arkit, seized some of the cities on the fringe of the empire. They grew rich on the caravans from the lands of the Padishah to the east, trading in their yurts for carpeted palaces. But they still lead raids into the heart of the empire, their swift horse archers spreading terror for leagues around their armies.
	(Minor faction:) The Hawlan are unsubjugated nomads, living on the fringes of the Khuzait's kingdom. Other Khuzait mock them for living only in yurts and smelling like the sheep dung they use for their fuel. They are what the Khuzait used to be, but despite this - or perhaps because of this - the newly rich, newly settled tribes treat them with scorn. Sons of Noyans have even been known to lead expeditions into the deep steppe to hunt them like animals. The Khergit however turned to them in their recent moment of crisis, using them as mercenaries.

		The Khergit, or Roan Horses, were one of the first peoples to be subjugated by Urkhun. Although assimilated into his confederacy by force, they proved themselves some of his most valuable warriors, and were rewarded with extensive lands in his new conquests. War however took a heavy toll of the clan's males, and ten years ago the Arkit made a bid for their territories. Mesui, sister of a slain noyan and part of a long tradition of steppe warrior-women, led the Khergit's counter-attack.
